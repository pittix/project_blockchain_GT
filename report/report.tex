- how does the protocol work: principles

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Network setup}

In order to assess and verify the expected properties of the \gls{batman}
protocol, we decided to run an event-driven simulation.

So, a certain number of entities were scattered uniformly across the simulation
area, as shown in \autoref{fig:nodes}. This strategy allows to change topology
simply switching the generator random seed and will be used for validating all our results.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  % \includegraphics[]{TODO}
  \caption{Nodes, labeled by their IP, are connected each other wirelessly.}
  \label{fig:nodes}
\end{figure}

Once placed, each couple of nodes close enough were linked by means of a
wireless fully reliable channel, characterized by a \gls{rtt} and a
retransmission probability $p_r$, both function of the reciprocal distance.

This assumption on the channel characteristics reduces the model complexity
while keeping an high degree of realism, as \gls{arq} strategies are common
practice at all protocol stack levels.

\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    p_r & = e^{-\frac{d}{D}} \\
    RTT &= 2 \frac{d}{c_0} + t_{proc}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

Given previous hypothesis, communication can be described by message exchange in
a directed graph made of \gls{batman}, channels and application layers, as shown
in \autoref{fig:graph}.

  % \includegraphics[]{TODO}
  \caption{Abstract graph spanning all logical components of the network.}
  \label{fig:graph}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Expected results}

In order to be as general as possible the consumers are memoryless sources of
traffic communicating from a node to another in our network: the \gls{batman}
layer has the goal to serve its users as best as it can.

To do so, each node has to rely, to a certain extent, to its neighbours since
not all destinations are reachable in a single hop.

From a game theoretical point of view, the \gls{batman} has two different
strategies in order to perform its duty.

Either it can collaborate with its own kind, using part of its bandwidth to
forward packets of other sources, or selfishly serve only its own packets.

As we will show in the upcoming \autoref{sec:results}, the protocol is designed
in such a way that the altruistic path is more convenient for the nodes to
pursue. The collaboration will turn out to be, in fact, a \gls{ne} for the game
played between all the connected entities.

We will furthermore analyze in which terms the network can sustain itself when a
growing fraction of its users are selfish or network conditions degrade.

\section{Results} \label{sec:results}

Network performances between fair and unfair users varying
- percentage of unfair users
- requested traffic (number and intensity of apps)
- channel quality
