\begin{abstract}
  In this course project we will show how a de-centralized telecommunication network using the popular \gls{batman} protocol can sustain itself without a central control.

  The key point to make this kind of systems feasible and reliable is to reward collaboration and penalize unwanted selfish behaviour: in this case the former consists in forwarding each others packets and the latter in dropping them.

  We will study, simulate and measure performances of a distributed infrastructure in order to empirically evaluate when collaboration is indeed the best strategy for the nodes to pursue, meaning when it is the game \gls{ne}.

\section{Introduction}

% - history\\

\gls{batman} was created in 2007 as a mesh networks protocol that allowed users to create network using their devices as nodes that routes traffic and transmit data to the network.

In 2008 it became \gls{batman}-adv breaking the ISO/OSI stack and exploiting knowledge at layer 2 and 3 to efficiently find paths and route the packets arriving to each node. During these years the protocol evolved and in 2011 became officially supported by the Linux Kernel, allowing all PCs to become a node in the network.

Since then, the protocol was widely tested, thanks to the Freifunk initiative, which aims to create a decentralized WiFi network and reaching all Germany.

% - how does the protocol work: principles

The protocol \gls{batman}-adv creates a network of ad-hoc connections where each node periodically notifies the neighbours of its presence using discovery messages.

Similarly to what is done in traditional distance-vector routing protocols, this information is used to build a local table that associates each known remote destination to the next hop for the packet to cross.

The peculiar feature of the \gls{batman} protocol is that together with the alive messages the nodes will periodically exchange their own local forwarding scheme. The emerging shared knowledge makes the connected entities aware of the global structure of the network, and so connections are more reliable and resilient even with mobile and non-persistent users.

In fact, when a node fails other ones can immediately find new paths upon being notified the change of topology.
Conversely, if a node starts acting selfishly, as it disregards forwarding other packets, the network will soon notice its unfair behaviour and will ignore all the packets coming from it.
This type of behaviour is pretty common to many decentralized networks, like MANETs \cite{MANETs} and protocols, like BitTorrent or ED2K, where a node that doesn't cooperate via the upload has a limited download capability.\cite{BitTorrent,ed2k}

While for smaller networks such global table can span the whole set of nodes, for bigger ones fixed gateways can be set in order to reach far destinations. This reduces the information required at each node and allows \gls{batman}-adv to run in home routers.

Like every de-centralized protocol, \gls{batman} relies on the contribution of all involved entities in order to sustain itself. Each node plays then a game, choosing between collaboration and egoism: this project aims to assess when the former is preferred to the latter and what kinds of rewards are needed for the players for the wanted behaviour to be the most convenient.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Network setup}

In order to study the protocol we decided to take an experimental approach, measuring objective functions of the players in a simulated setting.

As customary in this kind of analysis, a certain number $N$ of nodes is scattered uniformly across a square simulation area of side $L$, as shown in \autoref{fig:nodes}. This allows to change topology simply switching the generator random seed and will be used to validate all our results.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/example_graph}
  \caption{Nodes, labeled by their IP, are connected each other wirelessly.}
  \label{fig:nodes}
\end{figure}

Once placed, each couple of close nodes are linked with wireless fully reliable channels, characterized by a \gls{rtt} and a re-transmission probability $p_r$, both function of the reciprocal distance.

This assumption on the channel characteristics reduces the model complexity while keeping an decent degree of realism, as \gls{arq} strategies are common practice for all protocols of layers 2 and 3 that wants to maintain a reliable channel.

\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    p_r & = e^{-\frac{d}{D}} \\
    RTT &= 2 \frac{d}{c} + t_{proc}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
where $c$ is the speed of light, $t_{proc}$ the receiver processing time and $d$ the distance between the two nodes.
\smallskip

Up to this point of network building, nodes are able to communicate but there are still no users for our infrastructure.

Memoryless applications are then randomly and uniformly setup between pairs of points, according to a probability coefficient, called ``app rate''. A fraction of those, defined as ``selfish rate'', will act only for themselves, namely refusing to forward packets from other sources.

User satisfaction, measured in these layers, will be the key to judge the strategy adopted at the \gls{batman} layer.
Regardless of the cooperation or the selfishness of their routing units, which users in fact don't know nor care about, a good node can be easily recognized as the one whose applications are served with an high bitrate to the rest of the network.
To do so, it has to rely to a certain extent on its neighbours, since not all destinations are reachable in a single hop.

\smallskip
Once all details have been defined, the overall communication scenario can be described by messages exchanged in a directed graph made of \gls{batman}, channels and application layers, depicted in \autoref{fig:graph}.
We do not model packet collisions explicitly, as they are already included in the $p_r$. Another advantage is that we can treat the channel as a M/M/1 queue whose service is the packet delivery to the following step in the path.
Once the next hop has been reached, the node will properly handle the data, forwarding them until the destination.

\subsection{Expertiment steps}

As presented above, two different strategies can be chosen by each \gls{batman} layer in order to maximize its objective function: either it can collaborate with others, using part of its bandwidth to forward packets of other sources, or selfishly transmit only its own packets.

As we will show in the upcoming \autoref{sec:results}, if there were no form of punishment, nodes would be encouraged to act selfishly, expecially when others still respects the agreement.

The \gls{batman} protocol is for this reason designed in such a way that the altruistic path is more convenient for the nodes to pursue, pushing the rate of the selfish nodes close to zero.
If a one reportedly drops packets, in fact, its reputation lowers down to a point when all packets generated by the device itself are immediately dropped by neighbours, and do not reach their destination. The right to communicate with others can be eventually gained back when the unfair behaviour stops and packet forwarding starts again.

The collaboration will in fact turn out to be a \gls{ne} for the game played between all the connected entities.

A naive conception of a distributed routing algorithm could simply rely on the generosity of the nodes, hoping they will share their bandwidth to others.
Since this approach gives no substantial penalty to selfish players, they can still profit from the network while making the experience worse for everyone else.

As what can be seen in \autoref{fig:no-blame} and in \autoref{fig:no-blame-app-rate}, the two performance lines are very close to each other: no strategy is then  preferable to the other one in terms of profit for the players. For all the plots that we were able to obtain through the simulations, though, we can see that if the rate of the egoistic nodes is less than $0.167$, then a device is slightly encouraged to play his own game: dropping the other player's packets.
Over this limit, instead, playing altruistically is a bit incentivized, but the overall gain is limited.

This makes selfish behaviour a viable option, showing a big argument against this simple approach to distributed routing.

  \caption{Average bitrate in case no punishment is applied to selfish nodes}
  \label{fig:no-blame-app-rate}
\end{figure}

The \gls{batman} protocol tackles this issue creating a reputation score for each one of the members of the network, that increases when the node collaborates forwarding packets along their path and decreases when it ignores them to favour its own.

As shown in \autoref{fig:selfish-rate}, the altruistic way is always the preferred one, although it becomes less and less convenient when the ratio of selfish node grows. This has to be expected, as the overall performance drops when data are not being delivered to destination.

\section{Conclusion}

In this course project we showed how game theory can be the key to understand and design distributed routing protocols.

As proved in our study case of a wireless network, collaboration among participants has to be promoted with some kind of punishment for selfish behaviour.
Once this incentive has been set up, the systems is feasible and reliable even when a fraction of the users does not comply to the proposed \gls{ne} strategy.
