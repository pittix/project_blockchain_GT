\section{Introduction}

\section{BATMAN protocol overview}

% - history\\
\gls{batman} was born in 2007 as a mesh networks protocol that allowed users to
create network using their devices as nodes that routes traffic and transmit
data to the network.

In 2008 \gls{batman} became \gls{batman}-adv breaking the ISO/OSI stack and
exploiting the knowledge at layer 2 and 3 to efficiently find paths and route
the packets arriving to each node. During these years the protocol evolved and
in 2011 became officially supported by the Linux Kernel, allowing all PCs to
become a node in the network.

Since then, the protocol was widely tested, thanks to the Freifunk initiative,
which aims to bring to everyone a decentralized WiFi network and it's spread to
all Germany.

% - how does the protocol work: principles
The protocol \gls{batman}-adv creates a network of ad-hoc connections where each
node periodically notifies the neighbours of its presence using discovery
messages.

Similarly to what is done in traditional distance-vector routing protocols this
information will be used to build a local table that associates to each known
remote destination to the next hop for the packet to cross.

The peculiar feature of the \gls{batman} protocol is that together with this
alive messages the nodes will periodically exchange their own local forwarding
scheme. The emerging shared knowledge makes the connected entities aware of the
global structure of the network and so the connections are more reliable and
resilient to mobile and non-persistent nodes.

In fact, a node fails, the other ones can immediately find new paths upon being
notified the change of topology.

While for smaller networks such global table can span the whole set of nodes,
for bigger networks fixed gateways could be set in order to reach other parts of
the network. This reduces the information required at each node and allows
\gls{batman}-adv to run in home routers.

\smallskip

Like every de-centralized protocol, \gls{batman} relies on the contribution of
all involved entities in order to sustain itself. Each node plays then a game,
choosing between collaboration and egoism: this project aims to assess when the
former is preferred to the latter and what kinds of rewards are needed for the
players in order for the wanted behaviour to be the most convenient.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Network setup}

In order to assess and verify the expected properties of the \gls{batman}
protocol, we decided to run an event-driven simulation.

So, a certain number of entities were scattered uniformly across the simulation
area, as shown in \autoref{fig:nodes}. This strategy allows to change topology
simply switching the generator random seed and will be used for validating all our results.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  % \includegraphics[]{TODO}
  \caption{Nodes, labeled by their IP, are connected each other wirelessly.}
  \label{fig:nodes}
\end{figure}

Once placed, each couple of nodes close enough were linked by means of a
wireless fully reliable channel, characterized by a \gls{rtt} and a
retransmission probability $p_r$, both function of the reciprocal distance.

This assumption on the channel characteristics reduces the model complexity
while keeping an high degree of realism, as \gls{arq} strategies are common
practice at all protocol stack levels.

\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    p_r & = e^{-\frac{d}{D}} \\
    RTT &= 2 \frac{d}{c_0} + t_{proc}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

Given previous hypothesis, communication can be described by message exchange in
a directed graph made of \gls{batman}, channels and application layers, as shown
in \autoref{fig:graph}.

  % \includegraphics[]{TODO}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Expected results}

In order to be as general as possible, our network connects memoryless sources
of traffic communicating to each other: the \gls{batman} layer has the goal to
serve its users as best as it can. To do so, node have to rely to a certain
extent on their neighbours, since not all destinations are reachable in a single
hop.

From a game theoretical point of view, two different strategies can be chosen by
each layer in order to maximize its objective: either it can collaborate with
its own kind, using part of its bandwidth to forward packets of other sources,
or selfishly transmit only its own packets.

As we will show in the upcoming \autoref{sec:results}, the protocol is designed
in such a way that the altruistic path is more convenient for the nodes to
pursue. The collaboration will turn out to be, in fact, a \gls{ne} for the game
played between all the connected entities.

We will furthermore analyze in which terms the network can sustain itself when a
growing fraction of its users are selfish or network conditions degrade.
